A Jeopardy Live App for playing group Jeopardy in a Quip doc

How to play:

- Insert a Jeopardy live app. The person who inserts it is the "host", and will be responsible for adding answers and running the game.
- Players open the doc and add will add their answers directly in the game.
- The host adds questions and sets a value for the game.
- When you're ready to play, everyone opens the doc at the same time, and the host clicks "play"
- At any time, players or the host can click on "show leaderboard" to view the current player scores.
- The host asks players which square they want, and then when a player tells the host, the host clicks it.
- When the host chooses a square, it shows the question on all the players' screens, and starts a countdown timer. Players must enter an answer in the showing dialog before the timer runs out.
- After each question ends, the answers are shown to the host, who then selects the right answers.
- After the right answers are selected, the players who were correct are shown to the host. When you're finished congratulating them, the host closes the question window and the next round begins.
